        <h2><a href="#job-history">Job history</a></h2>
        <p>I added my most relevant jobs. For a full history, check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-sisto-a2674021/">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
        <ul>

            <h3>
              <img src="./assets/blockchain.svg" alt="Blockchain.com logo" />
            </h3>
            <p>Blockchain.com is one of the leading crypto companies out there. My focus there was on the <a href="https://exchange.blockchain.com/trade">exchange web app</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3><img src="./assets/xapo.svg" alt="Xapo logo"></h3>
            <p>Xapo is a bitcoin friendly fintech company. I worked there for a little over 5 years.</p>
            <p>I joined as a web team leader when the company was still small and stayed there until it was about 250 people.</p>
            <p>While young the company had a legacy webapp with some technical issues. I was assigned that app. My first steps were to improve it's release process and how to test it. Along with a team of 2 remote devs we implemented great features like the first debit card program. I learned the importance of deadlines and suffered from some urgent priorities shifts.</p>
            <p>Later on the company grew and we started hiring. The team grew from 2 to 8 devs, all of them remote with different time zones. By then we could finally invest in a new modern web application. <a href="https://web.xapo.com">Xapo webapp</a> <small>(Sorry, discontinued now)</small> is the biggest most challenging project I have worked on. It is a single page app built with React, redux and redux-saga. It uses a large set of techs which include: Docker, Firebase, AWS, Google analytics, sentry.io and many many more. It was not the technology but the amount of features and constant iteration which made it very complex.</p>
            <p>We had 2 weeks sprints with demos and releases at the end of each one. I participated in the definition of release and development processes.</p>
            <p>I ended up handling multiple projects with different needs, technology and audiences. From public legal pages aspects to internal tools for Xapo employees.</p>
            <p>I left the company because most web projects were being shut down. I have a great relationship with most of the company including everyone on my team, my bosses and the CEO.</p>
            <p>As a manager I tried to promote collaboration and allow mistakes to be made. Every standard was up for debate, once settled it went on stone for a while. Team members were empowered to propose a change for what they didn't like. I pushed some company wide tech exchanges and some team wide ones like Fridays "tech talk"</p>
            <p>Xapo was a great place for me to exchange experiences due to the diversity of roles people had in the company. I learned from debit and credit cards, compliance, design, trading, working with third parties, law and banking institutions.</p>
          </li>

            <h3><img src="./assets/kinetica.webp" alt="Kinetica Solutions logo"></h3>
            <p>Kinetica Solutions was a software consulting firm.</p>
            <p>I worked there for a little more than 4 years.</p>
            <p>Kinetica was where I formed myself as a senior developer. I was lucky to work with great developers. Company founders were strong believers in quality and agile methodologies.</p>
            <p>There I started my transition from a backend developer to a frontend one. I got to work on multiple projects from classic custom CRUDs for internal users on a retail company, to news sites widgets with millions of views per day.</p>
            <p>In this company I moved from mentored to mentor. I did frontend, I did backend, I did DBA, I did operations. Passed through a lot of tech and people, who molded my way of thinking.</p>
