        <h2><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Diego, Helena's father, Jimena's husband. I am from Argentina, the land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)">üßâ</a> and <a href="./assets/messi.jpg">Messi</a>.</p>
        <p>I have <strong>passion for software development</strong>. I am a senior developer with <span id="experience">-</span> years of experience in software development. I have worked with multiple tech stacks, but now I find myself comfortable around Javascript and frontend development.</p>
        <p>I have experience as a team leader. I ‚ô•Ô∏è building self organised teams with <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-by-stephen-covey-summary#:~:text=Interdependence%20is%20a%20more%20mature,laid%20out%20in%20the%20book.">interdependant</a> members that collaborate with each other.</p>
        <p>I have been working remotely for some years now. But I love meeting people face to face.</p>
        <p>I like to think my role in a company is broader than just to code. I keep asking me: <i>What's the best use of my time for the company now? What's next in the priority list?"</i></p>
        <p>When in doubt I'll say I don't know, but will do the homework and get the answer.</p>

        <h2><a href="#job-history">Job history</a></h2>
        <p>I added my most relevant jobs. For a full history, check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-sisto-a2674021/">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

              <img src="./assets/blockchain.svg" width="224" height="24" alt="Blockchain.com logo">
            </h3>
            <p>Blockchain.com is one of the leading crypto companies out there. My focus there was on the <a href="https://exchange.blockchain.com/trade">exchange web app</a>.</p>
            <p>My first challenge here was to work on a complicated codebase by myself. I was tasked to change the trade order input component so I reverse engineered the app to figure out how it worked. Then changed piece by piece to preserve functionality, doing lots of manual tests.</p>
            <p>My second big contribution was a bigger feature called simple trade. I interacted a lot with product manager, backend developers and designer. Which increases a lot my domain knowledge.</p>
            <p>Once I gained confidence around the app I took a chance to refactor some parts. I code implemented a route code split that reduced a lot first page load time. Refactored out dead code. And refactored the whole app to typescript. All this prove to speed up the app.</p>
            <p>Even though I was part of the frontend developers team, I was the sole developer for a while. That made me the point of contact for exchange questions around the company. Which stayed the same until my last day there.</p>
            <p>Eventually we grew into a team of 4. Which caused me to change a bit my positions into support for my teammates. I conducted team meetings, scheduled regular releases and set up objectives aligned with company goals.</p>

            <h3><img src="./assets/xapo.svg" width="150" height="45" alt="Xapo logo"></h3>
            <p>Xapo is a bitcoin friendly fintech company. I worked there for a little over 5 years.</p>
            <p>I joined as a web team leader when the company was still small and stayed there until it was about 250 people.</p>
            <p>While young the company had a legacy webapp with some technical issues. I was assigned that app. My first steps were to improve it's release process and how to test it. Along with a team of 2 remote devs we implemented great features like the first debit card program. I learned the importance of deadlines and suffered from some urgent priorities shifts.</p>
            <p>Later on the company grew and we started hiring. The team grew from 2 to 8 devs, all of them remote with different time zones. By then we could finally invest in a new modern web application. <a href="https://web.xapo.com">Xapo webapp</a> <small>(Sorry, discontinued now)</small> is the biggest most challenging project I have worked on. It is a single page app built with React, redux and redux-saga. It uses a large set of techs which include: Docker, Firebase, AWS, Google analytics, sentry.io and many many more. It was not the technology but the amount of features and constant iteration which made it very complex.</p>
            <p>We had 2 weeks sprints with demos and releases at the end of each one. I participated in the definition of release and development processes.</p>
            <p>I ended up handling multiple projects with different needs, technology and audiences. From public legal pages aspects to internal tools for Xapo employees.</p>
            <p>I left the company because most web projects were being shut down. I have a great relationship with most of the company including everyone on my team, my bosses and the CEO.</p>
            <p>As a manager I tried to promote collaboration and allow mistakes to be made. Every standard was up for debate, once settled it went on stone for a while. Team members were empowered to propose a change for what they didn't like. I pushed some company wide tech exchanges and some team wide ones like Fridays "tech talk"</p>
            <p>Xapo was a great place for me to exchange experiences due to the diversity of roles people had in the company. I learned from debit and credit cards, compliance, design, trading, working with third parties, law and banking institutions.</p>

            <h3><img src="./assets/kinetica.webp" width="172" height="48" alt="Kinetica Solutions logo"></h3>
            <p>Kinetica Solutions was a software consulting firm.</p>
            <p>I worked there for a little more than 4 years.</p>
            <p>Kinetica was where I formed myself as a senior developer. I was lucky to work with great developers. Company founders were strong believers in quality and agile methodologies.</p>
            <p>There I started my transition from a backend developer to a frontend one. I got to work on multiple projects from classic custom CRUDs for internal users on a retail company, to news sites widgets with millions of views per day.</p>
            <p>In this company I moved from mentored to mentor. I did frontend, I did backend, I did DBA, I did operations. Passed through a lot of tech and people, who molded my way of thinking.</p>
